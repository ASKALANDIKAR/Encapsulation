# Encapsulation💊😶‍🌫️

This project offers a hands-on exploration of Encapsulation in Java through practical, real-world examples like `BankAccount`, `Student`, `Employee`, and others—showcasing how to safeguard data and build robust, maintainable code.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `tka` package – Starting point to understand Encapsulation's working
- `Practice` – Individual files covering different Encapsulation-related problems (UpDating.....)
- `BankAccount` and `BandInfo` file are lengthy to understand for beginners🤔 

## 📌 Concepts Covered

This project helps understand the principles of **Encapsulation** in Object-Oriented Programming by:

- Using private fields with public getters and setters.
- Demonstrating how to protect data and control access.
- Creating reusable and maintainable code.

## 💡 Classes Overview

- **BankAccount**: Demonstrates encapsulated access to account details.
- **BankInfo**: Likely used for storing and retrieving bank-related info.
- **CallStud**: Might be used to call or manage `Student` objects.
- **Employee**: Represents encapsulated employee details.
- **Student**: A class showcasing encapsulated student attributes.
- **Demo**: Main class to execute or test functionality.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred IDE).
3. Navigate to the `Demo.java` file under `com.tka` package.
4. Run the `Demo` class.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Encapsulation.git
